# Logistic Regression Classifier â€“ AI, Data Science & ML Learning

## Task Overview

This project demonstrates a binary classification task using Logistic Regression as part of AI and Data Science learning practice. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset was used to build and evaluate the model.

## What Was Done

- Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (benign vs malignant)
- Preprocessing: Removed unnecessary columns, encoded labels
- Train-Test Split and Feature Scaling
- Model: Logistic Regression using scikit-learn
- Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC, ROC Curve
- Threshold Tuning for better control on classifier sensitivity

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## What You Learn

- Binary classification pipeline
- Logistic regression modeling
- Evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC)
- Sigmoid curve and threshold effect on classification

## Usage

Open and run the Colab notebook provided in segments. No comments are added per instruction to focus on clean execution.
